        <p>It all began as a kind of a joke to see if we were able to create a website using html and css. We didn't know it will scalate from there to CAW.</p>
        <p>So we decide it will be a good idea share our routes and pictures of our rides around the globe with other cyclists, using our own site and following our own rules. We post the GPX with some pics, so you can take a glimpse of what you'll find, but believe us when we say that no picture can beat reality, even our pics that are freaking awesome to say the least.</p>

            <p>CAW helped me a lot with my trip. They gave us great advice with hotels, better B roads and best time of the year to go to the Dolomites.Initially we wanted to go during the summer, but they told us that it was really trafficky so we changed our plans and advance the trip. It was a really good piece of advice as the locals told us later.</p>

            <p>We asked CAW for some routes in the French Alps. And they send new ones in addition to the ones they had at their website for free. They were very helpful because we had never been there before. They also gave us some tips about supermarkets, restaurants, gas stations and plenty of info to make each ride easier</p>
